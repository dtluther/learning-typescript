// Enums are one of the few features TS has which is not a type-level extension of JS.
// Enums allow a dev to define a set of named constances, which can make it easier to document intent or create a set of
// distinct cases. TS provides both numeric and string-based enums.

    // ...

// Numeric enums without initializers either need to be first or come after numeric enums initialized with numeric
// constance or other constant enum members. Basically, you can't do this:
var E;

    E[E["A"] = getSomeValue()] = "A";
    E[E["B"] = void 0] = "B"; // Error! Enum member must have initializer
})(E || (E = {}));
/////
//// String enums
// Similar concept, but have some runtime differences. In a string enum, each member has to be constant-initialized with
// a string literal or another string enum member.

// While they don't have auto-incrementing behavior, string-enums have the benefit that they "serialize" well. In other
// words, if you were debugging and had to read the runtime value of a numeric enum, the value doesn't convey any useful
// meaning on its own (though reverse maping can often help). String enums allow you to give a meaningful and readable
// value when your code runs, independent of the name of the emum member itself.
/////
//// Heterogeneous enums
// Techinically, they can be mixed. But not sure why you would want to (could be trying to manipulate JS's runtime
// behavior, but it's advised not to do this):

    BooleanLikeHeterogeneousEnum["Yes"] = "YES";
})(BooleanLikeHeterogeneousEnum || (BooleanLikeHeterogeneousEnum = {}));
/////
//// Computed and constant members
// Each enum member has a value associated with it that is constant or computed.
// Constant is defined as:
// 1) It is the first member in the enum and it has no initializer (value = 0):
var A;
(function (A) {
    A[A["A"] = 0] = "A";
})(A || (A = {}));
// 2) Does not have iniitalizer and the preceding enum member was a numeric constant (preceding value + 1):
var E1;
(function (E1) {
    E1[E1["X"] = 0] = "X";
    E1[E1["Y"] = 1] = "Y";
    E1[E1["Z"] = 2] = "Z";
})(E1 || (E1 = {}));
var E2;
(function (E2) {
    E2[E2["A"] = 1] = "A";
    E2[E2["B"] = 2] = "B";
    E2[E2["C"] = 3] = "C";
})(E2 || (E2 = {}));
// All members of E1 and E2 are constant.
// 3) The enum member is initialized with a constant enum expression, which is a subset of TS expressions that can be
// fully evaluated at compile time. An expression is a constanct enum expression if it is:
//     a) a literal enum expression (basically a string literal or numeric literal)
//     b) a reference to previously defined constant enum memeber (which can originate from a different enum)
//     c) a parenthesized constant enum expression
//     d) one of the +, -, ~ unary operators applied to constant enum expressioins
//     e) +, -, *, /, %, <<, >>, >>>, &, |, ^ binary operators with constant enum expressions as operands
// It is a compile time error for constant enum expressions to be evaluated to `NaN` or `Infinity`.
// In all other cases, emum members are considered computed.
var FileAccess;
(function (FileAccess) {
    // constant members
    FileAccess[FileAccess["None"] = 0] = "None";
    FileAccess[FileAccess["Read"] = 2] = "Read";
    FileAccess[FileAccess["Write"] = 4] = "Write";
    FileAccess[FileAccess["ReadWrite"] = 6] = "ReadWrite";
    // computed member
    FileAccess[FileAccess["G"] = "123".length] = "G";
})(FileAccess || (FileAccess = {}));
/////
//// Union emums and enum member types
// There is a special subset of constant enum members that arenâ€™t calculated: literal enum members. A literal enum
// member is a constant enum member with no initialized value, or with values that are initialized to
//     * any string literal (e.g. "foo", "bar, "baz")
//     * any numeric literal (e.g. 1, 100)
//     * a unary minus applied to any numeric literal (e.g. -1, -100)
// When all members in an enum have literal enum values, some special semantics come to play. The first is that enum
// members also become types as well! For example, we can say that certain members can only have the value of an enum
// member:
var ShapeKind;
(function (ShapeKind) {
    ShapeKind[ShapeKind["Circle"] = 0] = "Circle";
    ShapeKind[ShapeKind["Square"] = 1] = "Square";
})(ShapeKind || (ShapeKind = {}));
var c = {
    kind: ShapeKind.Square,
    radius: 100
};
// The other change is that enum types themselves effectively become a union of each enum member. With union enums, the
// type system is able to leverage the fact that it knows the exact set of values that exist in the enum itself. Because
// of that, TypeScript can catch silly bugs where we might be comparing values incorrectly. For example:
(function (E) {
    E[E["Foo"] = 0] = "Foo";
    E[E["Bar"] = 1] = "Bar";
})(E || (E = {}));
function f(x) {
    if (x !== E.Foo || x !== E.Bar) {
        //             ~~~~~~~~~~~
        // Error! This condition will always return 'true' since the types 'E.Foo' and 'E.Bar' have no overlap.
    }
}
